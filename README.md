# Smart Hide Chrome Extension  

Welcome to **Smart Hide**, an open-source Chrome extension that lets you manually hide unwanted elements on any webpage—and remembers your preferences for future visits!  

Whether it’s distracting ads, annoying pop-ups, or anything else cluttering your screen, Smart Hide helps you declutter and focus on what matters.

4. **Load the Extension**
